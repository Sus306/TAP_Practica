Minecraft Agent Framework

The goal of this task is to implement a Python framework enabling the development and
execution of Python coded agents in a Shared Minecraft server. The agent should be able to
move, interact with the environment, build and destroy blocks, and send or receive messages
from the chat.

Create examples like InsultBot (insulting in the chat and bothering users), TNTBot (an agent
deploying TNT and exploding it) or an OracleBot (answering questions in the chat using a list of
answers or a LLM like ChatGPT).

Demonstrate the use of funcional programming in Python with different examples.

Demonstrate the use of reflective programming in Python with different examples.

Create a github repository including documentation, examples and unit tests.
Include a github badge (github actions) demonstrating the code coverage of the code in your
repository.

Deliver all code and documentation in a self-contained zip file in moodle. Share with professor
in the interview your github repository to demonstrate codecov badge.

Optional:

1. Use the Pyro library to enable a remote client to interact with the server.

2. Using your framework, create a ChatBot agent that enables interaction with ChatGPT
using remote APIs. You will need to include a VISA card. Never include login and
pasword information in your github repositories.
3. Create a Minecraft world with a part of Tarragona (city) and propose educational
exercises or games on top of your framework related to Tarragona. This task is
designed for Tarragona schools (primary and secundary) so it must be relatively
simple.
